# Quest

Welcome to Quest

Quest is a small text-parsing engine. It was a learning exercise for me and is
very proof-of-concept and is very easy to break.

## How To

`clisp quest.cl`

## Graph Mapping

included is `graph-util.cl` which, if you have *graphviz* installed, you can
use to map out the location graph used in the game to a png file.

1. `clisp` - start the REPL

2. `(load "graph-utils.cl")`

3. `(load "quest.cl")` (and `quit` to exit the game)

4. `(graph->png "graph" *nodes* *edges*)` for a directed graph. or
`(ugraph->png "ugraph" *nodes* *edges*)` for an undirected graph. or, hell. do
both. why not.

5. `(bye)` - exit clisp

6. behold the glory of your graph
