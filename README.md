# land of lisp

I'm reading *Land of Lisp* and am working through all the exercises here.

## Contents

- 01-quest

    a little text parser for a little interactive fiction game. It seems be
    taken from the [*Casting Spels* zine][casting spels]

    includes a graphing utility to leverage DOT files and `graphviz` to draw
    the graph of locations (nodes) and exits (edges)

- 02-wumpus

    "Grand Theft Wumpus" is a hyper-violent reimagining of the classic [Hunt
    the Wumpus]. It features the graphing utility from the previous exercise as
    its UI.

- 03-orc-battle

    I wonder if this was an early inspiration of [Dwemthy's Array]

- 04-evolution

    a game of foraging life and death. this doesn't work quite as well as it
    ought to. it grinds down to a halt after ~1000 generations

- 05-robots

    this one is kind of a rip off because it was just a copy-and-paste program
    that the author said was not designed for the reader to fully understand or
    comprehend, but which only is only shown as an example for how powerful and
    crazy `loop` and `format` are.

    that is to say, I didn't write this and I didn't spend too much time trying
    to study or understand it.

- 06-http-server

    ports! sockets! actually this isn't quite working for some reason.

- 07-dice-wars

    I never got this game to work for some reason, and then I quit reading the
    book shortly thereafter.
